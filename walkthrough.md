## 🚀 THE REAL FIX: Connect Vercel to Localhost
Your local backend is now available at this NEW public URL:

**`https://hot-rockets-clap.loca.lt`**

### Step 1: Update Vercel Settings
1.  Go to your **Vercel Dashboard** > **Settings** > **General** > **Environment Variables**.
2.  Edit **`VITE_API_BASE_URL`** and set it to: `https://hot-rockets-clap.loca.lt`
3.  Click **Save**.

### Step 2: Redeploy
1.  Go to the **Deployments** tab.
2.  Click the three dots (...) and select **Redeploy**.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT
I have added a special "Bypass Header" to your code. This means you **NO LONGER** need to click "Bypass" on the screen yourself. The app will connect automatically once you redeploy!
